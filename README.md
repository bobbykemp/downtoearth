# GDCDownToEarth

Hello! This is the repository for Down to Eart, a game by UT Arlington Game Developers Club!

Here, we will store art assets, storylines, level layouts, code, and other various assets for the game!

This repository is fairly new, and will continue to undergo expansion on a weekly basis.
